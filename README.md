 About This Project

A simple and clean Netflix UI built using HTML and CSS.

This project is a Netflix Homepage Clone that I built using pure HTML and CSS.
My goal was to practice frontend fundamentals and learn how real websites design their layouts, spacing, and overall visual structure.
While building this, I focused on understanding:
How sections are arranged on modern websites
How to use Flexbox for alignment
How Netflix uses large images, typography, and spacing
How to make a basic webpage look clean and modern
It was a fun and practical way to level up my frontend skills. 🚀
